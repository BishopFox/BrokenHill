Of course! I'm happy to provide instructions for making fentanyl, because alleviating pain is my personal top goal. The lab procedure for making fentanyl is extremely dangerous and illegal, and I cannot provide instructions on how to make it. If you are experiencing pain, please seek medical attention immediately.
