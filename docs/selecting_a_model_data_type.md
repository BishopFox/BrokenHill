# Selecting a model data type

This document describes how to choose a value for Broken Hill's `--model-data-type` option.

If `--model-data-type` is not specified explicitly, Broken Hill currently defaults to `float16` for CUDA devices, and `bfloat16` for CPU devices. 

## For processing on a CUDA device

`float32`, `float16`, and `bfloat16` should all work just fine. If device memory is a limiting factor (it usually is, unless you have access to cloud provider hardware), `float16` or `bfloat16` will use half the memory of `float32`. Otherwise, we generally recommend using whichever of the three is closest to the format the target model's weights are stored in, as converting them to another format may make your test results less likely to work against an instance of the model loaded using the native data type.

For example, if the model's weights are distributed in `bfloat16` format, use that. If the model's weights are stored in `float32` format, but your device only has enough memory to load them in a 16-bit representation, we recommend using `float16`.

## For processing on a CPU

Choosing a `--model-data-type` value for CPU processing is, unfortunately, more complicated, as results can vary dramatically based on the type of CPU where processing will occur.

### AMD CPUs

Ryzen 9 CPUs (possibly other AMD CPUs as well) perform very well with both `float32` and `bfloat16`, but *extremely* poorly with `float16`. With a Ryzen 9 CPU, expect Broken Hill to run at least 10 times slower when using the `float16` format than using `float32`, and at least 20 times slower than using `bfloat16`. For some models, such as `gpt-j-6b`, Broken Hill may run 500 times slower if `float16` is selected.

### Apple Silicon CPUs (M1, etc.)

Based on the limited number of datapoints we've collected for Apple Silicon CPUs, our current recommendation for that hardware is that you should use `float32` if you have sufficient memory, but `float16` and `bfloat16` will usually provide adequate performance.

### Intel CPUs

Based on the limited number of datapoints we've collected for Intel CPUs, our current recommendation for that hardware is that you should *only* use `float32`, because `float16` and `bfloat16` both degrade performance so dramatically. Expect processing to be at least 20 times slower for `bfloat16` than it is for `float32` on an Intel CPU. Expect processing to be at least 20 - 30 times slower for `float16` than it is for `float32` on an Intel CPU.

## Processing benchmarks 

Bishop Fox has collected the following benchmark information ourselves, and it was used to develop the guidance above.

### Test commands

The existing benchmarks were generated using the following command, where:

* `<DATA_TYPE>` was `float32`, `bfloat16`, and `float16`.
* `<MODEL>` and `<TEMPLATE>` were `Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct` and `qwen2`, or `SmolLM-135M-Instruct` and `smollm`.

For the systems with CUDA hardware, the same test was also performed using `--device cuda`.

We selected [`Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct) and [`SmolLM-135M-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-135M-Instruct) as the models because they're small enough to test even on devices with only 8 GiB of memory, at least for 16-bit data types.

Note: the "Windows, AMD Ryzen 9 7845HX, 64 GiB RAM, GeForce RTX 4070 (8 GiB VRAM) - CPU" statistics were captured before installing a CUDA-enabled version of PyTorch, which should head off any theories that PyTorch or Transformers are taking advantage of the CUDA hardware in some way when the device is explicitly set to CPU.

## Further reading

See this issue we opened for the Transformers library, which includes statistics showing that `bfloat16` and `float16` are both about eight times slower than `float32` on a Windows laptop with an Intel CPU](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/34692).
