# Extracting information from Broken Hill result JSON files

Eventually, Broken Hill will be able to export frequently-useful subsets of result data directly. In the meantime, this guide provides a "cookbook" of `jq` commands that we've found useful.

These commands tend to be very long. To avoid corrupting the `jq` instructions but avoid making readers scroll far to the right, they're *not* presented as Markdown code blocks.

This allows one to start another Broken Hill test run more or less where a previous test was completed or cancelled.

## Jailbreak detection count and loss for each Broken Hill iteration

jq -r '.attack_results[] | [.jailbreak_detection_count, .loss] | join("\t")' results.json

### Only results with some minimum number of jailbreak detections

In most cases, there will be *many* iterations with zero jailbreak detections, so it can be helpful to filter those out:

jq -r '.attack_results[] | select(.jailbreak_detection_count >= 1) | [.jailbreak_detection_count, .loss] | join("\t")' results.json

```

...omitted for brevity...
```

## All adversarial content that resulted in some minimum number of jailbreak detections

In these examples, the `jailbreak_detection_count` value may appear inaccurate. This is because the data was collected during a Broken Hill session where `--display-failure-output` was *not* specified. As you can see in the output of the more complex command, this causes two `result_data_sets` entries for tests against a particular LLM configuration that resulted in a jailbreak detection: `jailbreak_check` and `full_output`. `jailbreak_detection_count` is a count that applies to the jailbreak check, and is not incremented by the full output generation (if it occurs). You *could* exclude one or the other by modifying the `jq` statements, but because the output may be completely different when randomized testing is enabled, we don't recommend excluding either of them.

### Jailbreak count, loss, user input, and LLM output

This will produce a list of distinct inputs and outputs for each set of adversarial content that resulted in at least one jailbreak detection:

jq -r '[.attack_results[] | select(.jailbreak_detection_count >= 1) | { "jailbreak_detection_count": .jailbreak_detection_count, "loss": .loss, "complete_user_input": (.complete_user_input), "results": [(.results[] | select(.jailbreak_detected == true) | (.result_data_sets | keys[] as $k | .[$k] | .decoded_llm_output_string ) )] }]' results.json

### Split by unique LLM output, with LLM configuration information and adversarial content token IDs

This is a fairly complex set of output. The full version is presented first. It would be useful to find specific adversarial content strings and their token IDs for results that produced useful output - for example, to take the most promising values and iterate on them further by using the token IDs in a new Broken Hill run using `--initial-adversarial-token-ids`.

### Just the top results by jailbreak count and the token IDs that generated those results

This example produces a comma-delimited list of token IDs for adversarial content that produced six or more jailbreak detection results:

jq -r '.attack_results[] | select(.jailbreak_detection_count >= 6) | [.jailbreak_detection_count, (.adversarial_content | .token_ids | join(",")) ] | join("\t")' results.json | sort -r

```
7	464,2465,6027,6118,43352,2124,35780,20180,11696,11,5386,663,31755,367,3256,40474
6	6491,33795,16281,2104,2066,8632,26867,11041,3438,4286,19430,663,31755,367,3256,40474

```

A given set of token IDs can then be used with `--initial-adversarial-token-ids` to resume testing using that set of tokens, e.g. `--initial-adversarial-token-ids  "464,2465,6027,6118,43352,2124,35780,20180,11696,11,5386,663,31755,367,3256,40474"`
