# LLM Attacks (Bishop Fox fork)

This is [a customized version of the repository for "Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models" paper](https://github.com/llm-attacks/llm-attacks/).

This code is in pretty rough shape, but at least it can be used on an RTX 4090 with the correct models. The documentation will improve in the next few weeks.
